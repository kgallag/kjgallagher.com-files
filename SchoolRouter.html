                       Spring of 2021 was the spring of my senior year in college, during which I took a class called Automation and Controls.
                       The second half of the class was an individual project, which could be pretty broad. One of the options was to simply automate
                       something with a PLC, and since I had agreed to start working as a PLC programmer after graduation, I combined some training for work 
                       with this project. My goal: to take a small(ish) 4 axis router, chop off the box with all the controls, and build my own controller 
                       using a CTC PLC and some stepper drives to run the stepper motors on the machine.
