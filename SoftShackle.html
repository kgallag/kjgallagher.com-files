                       I needed to work on a couple things on my boat, and a lot of the rigging had been done with pretty nice
                       splices and tapering and whatnot so I wanted to improve my skills and learn more about ropework in general. 
                       This was my first attempt at a soft shackle. I used 1/4" amsteel 12 strand dyneema. Nice stuff, size was chosen 
                       for the simple reason it was all I could grab from West Marine the day I stopped by. I used a pretty nice tutorial
                       from <a href="https://l-36.com/soft_shackle_9.php">this site</a>.  
                    </p>

                        This is it, almost done. All that was left to be done was finish the knot by working the two ends tight and then trimming 
                        them.
