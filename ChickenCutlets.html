                     <b>1) Nicks Pizza (Mattapoisett, MA) - </b>Great crispy chicken, classic style, well balanced, all around a winner. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <b>2) A1 Pizza (Little Compton, RI) - </b>Just an all time sandwich. Good crunch, good amount of mayo, good lettuce, just all around a reliable good time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>3) Famous Pizza (Tiverton, RI) - </b>Tough to place Famous to be honest. On a good day, these cutlets absolutely can challenge for the top spot. Every so 
                      often though, you run into an oddball. Really runny mayo, or not the greatest chicken. If these random blips get cleaned up and things become a little more 
                      consistent, look out for Famous Pizza. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>4) Classic Pizza (Tiverton, RI) - </b>Look, no chicken cutlet is a bad chicken cutlet, but this one was not my favorite. Did not feel like it was made with any 
                    love. 
                    </p>
